        <p>
            The Crop Selection System operates through a combination of user input, sensor data, weather patterns, and historical yield information.
            Here's a simple overview:
        </p>
        <ol class="mt-3">
            <li><strong>Input:</strong> The user enters soil type, location, weather, and other relevant conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The system processes this data using AI models trained on agricultural datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> It recommends the most suitable crops, including yield expectations and best planting times.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-4">It is designed to support both individual farmers and agricultural extension agents.</p>
