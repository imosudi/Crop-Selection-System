# Crop Selection System

## Objective
Recommend crops for planting based on climate

## Possible Computational Techniques
1. Climate-crop matching
2. Suitability scoring

## Flask UI Component
1. Inputs for soil and weather; crop list with icons

## Types of Dataset
1. Agricultural yield data
2. climate suitability models

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. Agricultural research institutes
2. FAO databases

## Dataset URLs
1. https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data
2. http://www.agris.fao.org/
